Installation
-

There is a database.sql in the root directory. It will generate the frequent database.

Do a `composer install` in the root directory. And composer will install all dependencies.

I have used several packages. Please install them and follow their installation instructions:
* [Laravel IDE Helper Generator] (https://github.com/barryvdh/laravel-ide-helper)
* [Laravel 4 Debugbar] (https://github.com/barryvdh/laravel-debugbar)
* [Cartalyst Sentry] (https://cartalyst.com/manual/sentry)
* [Laravel GitHub] (https://github.com/GrahamCampbell/Laravel-GitHub)
* [Eloquent Sluggable] (https://github.com/cviebrock/eloquent-sluggable)
* The initial library list used contents of the [Android Arsenal] (http://android-arsenal.com) Thanks for that!
